Build your own browser-based text games using Django!

Please be nice! This is my first time building a Django module, and there is a lot to learn about publishing code to GitHub. I write code for fun, as a hobby -- if you find any glaring holes, feel free to let me know, or patch them yourself. That's the great thing about open-source code!

# Notes:
1. This module is built on and requires Django, which is a lightweight full-stack web development framework using Python to communicate from a front-end webpage to a back-end database. If you do not know how to use Django yet, I recommend Traversy Media, Corey Schafer, and Programming with Mosh on YouTube to learn the basics!
2. Usually Django will create you a sqlite database as a starter, but you can use many different relational databases (see Django's documentation for more information). This module does not require any particular type of relational database, but we have included a basic .sql file compatible with a sqlite database, which you can use to build you some "test" Stories and Story Blocks to mess around with and get the feel of the module.
